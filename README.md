# NEAT-based Flappy Bird Agent

An agent that is trained to play "Flappy Bird" by learning using NEAT algorithms in a custom built PyGame environment.



## Lessons Learned

This project helped me get a deeper understanding of **genetic algorithms** that integrate with **neural networks.** 

This project is also a testament to my understanding of **PyGame*.*
## Features

- Customizable **config.txt** file
- Live Learning visualisation
- **Custom-built** PyGame environment 
- **NEAT** based AI agent that learns to play quickly
